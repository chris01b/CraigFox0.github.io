					<h3>Newletters</h3>
					<p>This Thursday (07-28) we will meet at Tyler State Park by the boat house from 6:30-8:00. Please wear your Class B Uniform and bring a water bottle. We will go over information for the Ski House trip and then we will break up into patrols for patrol activities. The Patrol Leaders will let their patrols know what activity they will be participating in (hiking, fishing, etc.) so that everyone can prepare accordingly. If anyone needs a rank advancement, please have them email their patrol leader so we can plan accordingly.<br>
